# Flask-API-Example
Just a simple example flask API

Originally created this to help myself understand APIs, what makes them tick and how to interact with them.
Feel free to do what ever you wish with this code. 


The login credentials are ```"test:test"```

Additionally added a Python-Pickle deserialization exploit in as inspired by Hackthebox's Baby Website Rick Challenge. 

A good write-up to refer to on how to exploit such a vulnerability is over here:https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/hackthebox/challenges/web/baby-website-rick.
You can use the Evil_Pickle.py file to generate a malicous python object to achieve code execution through the API.

Remember to use ```pip install -r requirements.txt ```
